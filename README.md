## Externship Through Besample (17 April 2024 â€“ 11 June 2024)
 
**Company Overview:** Besample is an independent startup dedicated to promoting global diversity in the social sciences by providing researchers with access to data from participants in countries that are often underrepresented in social science research.

**Company Website:** https://besample.app/

**Project Objective:** Identify the typical behaviors of bot accounts that infiltrated Besample and provide strategies for quickly detecting future bots.

**Skills Demonstrated:** Bayesian statistics, time series modeling, feature engineering, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and principal component analysis (PCA)

**Breakdown of Tasks Completed:** In total, I used four Jupyter notebooks, each serving a specific purpose as outlined below. To ensure the sensitive data of Besample users remain secure, I have deliberately excluded the notebooks (and datasets) from this repository. I invite you to watch the video of my presentation to Besample representatives to gain a comprehensive understanding of my contributions to the project.

***Notebook 1***: Initial data cleaning, data analysis, and feature engineering for the primary dataframe, including time series graphs.

***Notebook 2***: Data cleaning and analysis for the additional dataframes, along with further feature engineering for all dataframes. Also, started merging dataframes. (Time series graphs were excluded for brevity.)

***Notebook 3***: Another round of feature engineering.

***Notebook 4***: Engineered a possible replacement for the original target column, conducted PCA, and revisited the time series graphs from Notebook 1.
